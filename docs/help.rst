Getting Help
############

There are a couple of ways to get help with using :code:`yt-napari`:

1. Open a `github bug report <https://github.com/data-exp-lab/yt-napari/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug-report.md&title=>`_ when
encountering errors or a `github discussion issue <https://github.com/data-exp-lab/yt-napari/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feedback-and-discussion.md&title=>`_ to ask a
question.

2. Join the yt slack! Follow instructions over at `<https://yt-project.org/community.html>`_ to join the yt slack and
then add yourself to the :code:`#yt-napari` channel and ask away! This is also where :code:`yt-napari` announcments get posted
when they don't warrant a larger :code:`yt-user` announcement.
